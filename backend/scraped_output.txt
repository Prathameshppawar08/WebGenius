Gaming Beast
Reviewed in India on 18 May 2025Verified Purchase


I am writing this review after using this beauty for around 15 days and I must say it's a beast in all categories be it CPU, GPU, SSD, RAM and the most powerful is the battery life, I mean I have used almost all gaming brand laptops Asus, Acer, MSI but none of them could manage to give me a battery backup of 3+ hrs. But this beast is giving me around 7+ hrs of backup on normal usage of downloading, surfing and streaming. Till date I haven't seen any heating issues with the laptop.You might get distracted due to some negative comments of this laptop but trust me you would not regret a bit after buying this laptop.FPS in games-Indiana Jones- 85-90 FPS in ultra settingsValorant - 230 FPS in ultraRest all will update after playing some new games.

Powerful Machine: delivers what promises
Reviewed in India on 11 May 2025Verified Purchase
One of the best purchase. Smooth, powerful and if you got muscle then portable too XD. Good speakers, very nice screen, decent built(I shifted from Mac so used to of another level of build).Nice tacky keyboard, and good trackpad.If you're into Development and Gaming then this is the machine. As of 2025, it can run almost anything you throw to this machine.

this period about laptop warranty upgradation.Recently, I attempted to extend the warranty from 1 year to 3 years. However, I was informed that the seller — Clicktech Retail Pvt Ltd (from whom I purchased the laptop on Amazon) — is not an authorized HP seller. As a result, I am now unable to avail the extended warranty offer.This was not mentioned at the time of purchase, and I was unaware that buying from an unauthorized seller would impact warranty benefits. Going forward, I understand the importance of checking for authorized sellers before making a purchase.I kindly request your support or guidance on any possible solution or next steps in this situation.
